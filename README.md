### Duolingo Stats

Duolingo Stats is intended to be a replacement for Duolingo Weekly Progress. You should uninstall or disable Duolingo Weekly Progress if you install this.

Current features:

* Shows you a progress chart for the last 7 days, on your home page and on other people's profiles.
* Shows you other people's trees on their profile (after you click on "Show the tree").

Planned features:

* Show all certificates a person has earned, including the score for each certificate and the date/time test was taken.
* Show the amount of points a person has in each language.
* Show a person's all-time ranking among their followers.

Known bugs / limitations:

* Progress charts and trees are only shown for the language the person is currently learning.
* Trees don't show divisions between sections or bonus skills.
* The text for showing/hiding the tree is still only in English.
* The progress chart on your home page won't update after using immersion until you refresh the page or do a lesson/practice.
* Still being tested.
